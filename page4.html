        <h3>Digital Responsibility</h3>
        <p>In today’s digital world, I believe it is important to use technology with honesty and responsibility. 
            Being online gives us many opportunities to learn and connect, 
            but it also comes with the responsibility to use information wisely.
            <br>
            I always remind myself to verify information before sharing it, especially on social media. 
            Not everything we see online is true, so checking facts helps avoid spreading misinformation. 
            I also try to practice respect and kindness in my online interactions, knowing that my words and actions can affect others. 
            For me, being digitally responsible means using technology in a way that reflects good values and positive character.</p>

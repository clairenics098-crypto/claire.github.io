        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p> I always remember our school mantra, “Una ang Ginoo,” and that we are “The Light of the World.” 
            This teaches me to have faith in God and trust His plan for me. 
            Faith helps me stay strong and make good choices.
            Integrity means doing what is right, even if no one is watching. 
            It reminds me to be honest and responsible in everything I do. 
            By having integrity, I can be a good example to others.
            <br>
            Being a responsible digital citizen is also important. 
            We should use the internet in a good way, respect others, 
            and think before we post or share anything.
            <br>
            Faith, integrity, and responsible digital citizenship help me grow as a student and a person. 
            By following these, I can shine as a light in my school and honor God in my life..</p>

        <h4>Why do we need to Participate in Community Service or Advocacy</h4>
        <p>Participating in community service or advocacy is important 
           because it allows us to make a positive impact on the lives of others. 
           Through activities like charity events, outreach programs, or 
           environmental campaigns, we can help people in need and improve our communities.
           Being involved also teaches us responsibility, teamwork, and empathy. 
           It helps us understand the challenges others face and encourages us to act with kindness and compassion. 
           Personally, I believe that participating in these programs is not just about helping others 
           it is also about growing as a person, practicing our values, and living out our faith by serving 
           God through service to others.</p>
